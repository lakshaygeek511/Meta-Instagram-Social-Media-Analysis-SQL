# 📸 Social Media Analysis — Meta · Instagram Clone

### A comprehensive SQL-driven analysis of a Instagram clone dataset to uncover actionable marketing insights on user engagement, retention, content strategy & campaign targeting.

---

</div>

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> As data analysts embedded with the **Marketing Team**, the goal is to transform raw engagement data from an Instagram-like relational database into concrete, data-backed strategies.

The Marketing team needs data-driven strategies to:
- 📈 **Increase** user engagement across the platform
- 🔁 **Improve** user retention and reduce churn
- 🚀 **Drive** new user acquisition via organic & paid channels
- 🎯 **Optimise** ad campaigns using hashtag, timing & content insights
- 🏆 **Identify & reward** the most loyal and valuable users

Without insights from existing data, campaigns remain generic and underperform. This analysis **bridges that gap**.

---
## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset is a relational clone of Instagram's core data model, consisting of **7 interconnected tables**:

<img width="2084" height="1172" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f56bf9e-fac0-45a3-8c2f-4170cf39c3d3" />

Dataset Scale:
~100 users in the relational clone
6th month, year 2025 temporal focus for engagement trends
257 posts analyzed for peak-hour engagement
8,782 likes & 7,488 comments measured across peak activity

---
## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Quality Check

| Check Performed | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Duplicate detection | `GROUP BY` + `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` | ✅ No duplicates found |
| NULL value check | `WHERE column IS NULL` | ✅ No nulls found |
| Duplicate deletion (if any) | `ROW_NUMBER()` window function + `DELETE` | ✅ Ready to use |
| Data integrity | Cross-table JOIN validation | ✅ All foreign keys consistent |

> ✅ **Dataset was found to be completely clean** — no duplicates or missing values across all 7 tables, allowing analysis to proceed directly without any data imputation.

---

## 🔍 Methodology

| Step | Action | Technique |
|---|---|---|
| **01 — Data Cleaning** | Check duplicates & NULLs across all tables | `ROW_NUMBER()`, `WHERE IS NULL`, `HAVING` |
| **02 — Exploratory SQL** | Compute per-user activity distributions | `LEFT JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `COUNT(DISTINCT)` |
| **03 — Engagement Scoring** | Rank users by likes + comments + posts | `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, CTEs |
| **04 — Hashtag Analysis** | Find top hashtags by avg likes per post | CTEs on `photo_tags` & `tags`, `AVG()` |
| **05 — Temporal Analysis** | Identify peak posting & engagement hours | `EXTRACT(HOUR)`, grouped aggregation |
| **06 — Insights & Strategy** | Translate SQL outputs to recommendations | Business analysis & marketing strategy |

---

## 📊 Objective Questions & Key Findings

### Q1 — Data Quality: Duplicate & NULL Values
> **Result:** No duplicates or nulls found across any table. Dataset is production-ready.

---

### Q2 — User Activity Distribution (Posts, Likes, Comments)
> **Approach:** `LEFT JOIN` across `users → photos`, `likes`, `comments`. `COUNT(DISTINCT)` per metric.

**Key Insight:**
- Top **10%** of users generate ~**60%** of all posts & engagement — a classic Pareto distribution.
- **40%** of users show little-to-no activity — a significant re-engagement opportunity.

---

### Q3 — Average Tags Per Post
> **Approach:** CTE on `photo_tags` → `COUNT(DISTINCT tag_id)` per photo → `AVG()` of tag counts.

**Key Insight:** Calculated the average number of hashtags per post across the entire platform, serving as a baseline for content tagging strategy.

---

### Q4 — Top Users by Engagement Rate
> **Approach:** Two CTEs for total likes & total comments per user → combined via `INNER JOIN` → ranked with `DENSE_RANK()`.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Avg Platform Engagement | **63** |
| Top User Score | **1,720** |
| Top Users Multiplier | **4–6×** platform average |

**Key Insight:** Top 20 users show engagement rates **4–6× the platform average**, making them ideal brand ambassador or early-access candidates.

---

### Q5 — Highest Followers & Followings
> **Approach:** Two CTEs (`count_follower`, `count_following`) → `LEFT JOIN` with `users` → `COALESCE()` for zero-fill.

**Key Insight:** Identifies high-reach accounts ideal for organic growth campaigns and influencer seeding.

---

### Q6 — Average Engagement Rate Per Post Per User
> **Approach:** Three-CTE pipeline (`Post_Likes` → `Post_Comments` → `Engagement`) → `AVG(total_engagement)` per user.

**Key Insight:** Surfaces users with the strongest per-post performance, uncovering quality creators vs. high-volume low-quality posters.

---

### Q7 — Users Who Never Liked Any Post
> **Approach:** `LEFT JOIN` users with likes → `WHERE likes.photo_id IS NULL`.

**Key Insight:** These passive users are prime candidates for targeted re-engagement nudges and gamification prompts.

---

### Q8 — Most Used Hashtags (Ad Campaign Targeting)
> **Approach:** `JOIN tags → photo_tags` → `GROUP BY tag_name` → `ORDER BY COUNT DESC`.

**Key Insight:** Most-used tags signal the strongest organic interest areas for ad creative alignment.

---

### Q9 — Monthly Engagement Ranking
> **Approach:** `Post_likes` + `Post_comments` CTEs → `DENSE_RANK()` on `total_engagement DESC`.

> **Note:** Likes & comments data is available for **June 2025 only** in this dataset.

---

### Q10 — Top Hashtags by Average Likes
> **Approach:** `Likes_Count` CTE → `JOIN tags → photo_tags → Likes_Count` → `AVG(LikesCount)` per tag → `ORDER BY Avg_likes DESC`.

**Key Insight:**

| Rank | Hashtag | Theme |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | #Beauty | Lifestyle |
| 2 | #Delicious | Food |
| 3 | #Foodie | Food |
| 4 | #Dreamy | Aesthetic |
| 5 | #Food | Food |
| 6 | #Photography | Creative |
| 7 | #Smile | Lifestyle |
| 8 | #Stunning | Aesthetic |
| 9 | #Sunset | Nature/Travel |
| 10 | #Beach | Nature/Travel |

> 🍕 **Beauty, Food & Photography dominate** — ad creative and influencer briefs aligned to these themes will maximise organic reach.

---

### Q11 — Users Who Followed Back After Being Followed
> **Approach:** Self-join on `follows` table (swap `follower_id ↔ followee_id`) → filter `f1.created_at > f2.created_at`.

**Key Insight:** Reveals reciprocal follow behaviour patterns — a key signal of community formation and healthy social graph growth.

---

## 💡 Subjective Questions & Strategy Recommendations

### SQ1 — Who Are the Most Loyal & Valuable Users?
> **Engagement Score = Total Likes + Total Comments + Total Posts**

Ranked using `RANK() DESC` across a multi-CTE pipeline aggregating all activity signals per user.

**Reward & Incentive Strategies:**

| Strategy | Description |
|---|---|
| 🏅 Custom Badges | "Top Creator", "Power User", "Community Leader" — public recognition |
| 🛠️ Early Feature Access | Analytics dashboards, content scheduling, engagement insights |
| 🎉 Exclusive Events | Virtual & in-person networking events for top performers |
| 🎁 Discounts & Credits | Platform credits and partner discounts to reward loyalty |

---

### SQ2 — How Do We Re-engage Inactive Users?
> Same scoring as SQ1 but `RANK() ASC` to surface lowest-engagement users. `COALESCE()` fills NULLs with 0.

**Re-engagement Strategies:**

| Strategy | Description |
|---|---|
| 📧 Personalised Emails | Show missed popular content & tailored recommendations |
| 🔔 In-App Nudges | Milestone alerts (e.g., "You're 10 away from 100 followers!") |
| 🎮 Gamification | Weekly posting streaks, "Most Liked Photo" contests with rewards |
| 📝 Content Templates | Ready-to-post prompts & re-onboarding guides for returning users |
| 💬 Feedback Loops | Update Explore page to highlight content matching past interests |

---

### SQ3 — Which Hashtags Drive the Highest Engagement?
> Two CTEs (`Likes`, `Comments`) → join `tags → photo_tags → CTEs` → `AVG(likes + comments) / posts` per tag → `TOP 10 DESC`.

**Content Strategy & Ad Campaign Implications:**

| Strategy | Action |
|---|---|
| 📅 Content Planning | Creators incorporate top hashtags to boost visibility |
| 🎯 Ad Targeting | Align ad themes to Food, Beauty, Travel & Photography |
| 📆 Trend Alignment | Launch seasonal campaigns with #sunset, #beach, #stunning |
| 🤝 Influencer Collabs | Partner with creators who regularly use top-10 hashtags |
| 🔗 Hashtag Pairing | Combine branded + popular tags (e.g., #delicious + #foodie) for discoverability |

---

### SQ4 — Peak Engagement Hours for Targeted Marketing
> Two CTEs for likes & comments per photo → joined with `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM created_at)` → `AVG((likes + comments) / posts)` per hour.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| 🕖 Peak Engagement Hour | **7 PM** |
| ⭐ Max Avg Engagement Score | **63** |
| 📊 Posts in Peak Window | **257** |
| 👍 Likes in Peak Window | **8,782** |
| 💬 Comments in Peak Window | **7,488** |

**Key Insight:** Scheduling ads, promoted posts, and push notifications at **7 PM** will maximise reach and interaction rates. Pair this with top hashtags for compounding impact.
